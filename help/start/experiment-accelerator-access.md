# Access Journey Optimizer Experimentation Accelerator

After [creating and configuring your experiment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer/using/content-management/content-experiment/content-experiment) and sending your campaigns or journeys to your profiles, you can access the **[!UICONTROL Journey Optimizer Experimentation Accelerator]** to dive deeper into how your experiment is performing.

You can access **[!UICONTROL Journey Optimizer Experimentation Accelerator]** either from the left-hand menu from the [!UICONTROL Experimentation] drop-down or via the Apps switcher. Note that users with only a Target license can access it only through the Apps switcher.
