# Track your experiments {#monitor}

The **[!UICONTROL Experiments]** tab centralizes the tracking and analysis of tests from Adobe Journey Optimizer and Adobe Target. You can view all experiments, review KPIs, and filter or search to locate specific tests.

## Dashboard {#dashboard}

When accessing the Experiments tab, all available experiments from Journey Optimizer and Adobe Target are listed in a consolidated view. This allows you to quickly review and compare experiments across both platforms in one place. 
The Experiments list includes:

* Journey Optimizer experiments created in either Campaigns or Journeys.

* Adobe Target experiments available in the Journey Optimizer production default sandbox linked to the same IMS organization.

The KPI section provides key metrics, including the total number of experiments created and the number currently in progress, offering a snapshot of overall experimentation activity

Access filters by clicking ![](assets/do-not-localize/Smock_Filter_18_N.svg), which offers context-specific options such as filtering by **[!UICONTROL Type]**, **[!UICONTROL Starred]**, **[!UICONTROL Status]**, or **[!UICONTROL Source]**. For example, you can filter to show only active experiments from Journey Optimizer.

Alternatively, quickly find your experiment by typing its name into the search bar.
